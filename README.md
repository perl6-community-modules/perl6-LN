# NAME

NL - Get IO::CatHandle's current handle's line number


# SYNOPSIS

```perl6
perl -wlnE  'say "$.:$_"; close ARGV if eof' foo bar # Perl 5
perl6 -MLN -ne 'say "$*LN:$_"' foo bar               # Perl 6

```

# DESCRIPTION

# EXPORTED TERMS

This module exports terms (not subroutines), so you don't need to use
parentheses to avoid block gobbling errors. Just use these same way as you'd
use constant `Ï€`

If you have to use parens for some reason, make them go around the
whole them, not just the args:

```perl6
     make-temp-path(:content<foo> :chmod<423>) # WRONG
    (make-temp-path :content<foo> :chmod<423>) # RIGHT
```

## `&term:<make-temp-path>`

Defined as:

```perl6
    sub term:<make-temp-path> (
        :$content where Any|Blob:D|Cool:D, Int :$chmod --> IO::Path:D
    )
```

Creates an [`IO::Path`](https://docs.perl6.org/type/IO::Path) object pointing
to a path inside
[`$*TMPDIR`](https://docs.perl6.org/language/variables#index-entry-%24%2ATMPDIR)
that will be deleted (see [DETAILS OF DELETION](#details-of-deletion)
section below).

Unless `:$chmod` or `:$content` are given, no files will be created. If
`:$chmod` is given a file containing `:$content` (or empty, if no `:$content` is
given) will be created [with `:$chmod`
permissions](https://docs.perl6.org/type/IO::Path#method_chmod). If `:$content`
is given without `:$chmod`, the mode will be the default resulting from
files created with
[`IO::Handle.open`](https://docs.perl6.org/type/IO::Handle#method_open).

The [basename](https://docs.perl6.org/type/IO::Path#method_basename)
of the path is currently a SHA256 hash, but your program should
not make assumptions about the format of the basename.

**Security Note:** at the moment, `:chmod` is set *after* the file is
created and its content is written. This will be fixed once a way to create a
file with a specific mode is available in Rakudo. While it will work at the
moment, it might not be the best idea to assume `:$content` will be successfully
written if you set `:$chmod` that does not let the current process write to the
file.

## `&term:<make-temp-dir>`

Defined as:

```perl6
    sub term:<make-temp-dir> (Int :$chmod --> IO::Path:D)
```

Creates a directory inside
[`$*TMPDIR`](https://docs.perl6.org/language/variables#index-entry-%24%2ATMPDIR)
that will be deleted (see [DETAILS OF DELETION](#details-of-deletion)
section below) and returns the
[`IO::Path`](https://docs.perl6.org/type/IO::Path) object pointing to it.

If `:$chmod` is provided, the directory will be created with that mode.
Otherwise,  the [default `.mkdir`
mode](https://docs.perl6.org/type/IO::Path#routine_mkdir) will be used.

Note that currently `.mkdir` pays attention to
[`umask`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umask) and `make-temp-dir` will first
the `:$chmod` to `.mkdir`, to create `umask` masked directory, and then it will
[`.chmod`](https://docs.perl6.org/type/IO::Path#method_chmod) it, to remove
the effects of the `umask`.

# DETAILS OF DELETION

The deletion of files created by this module will happen either when
the returned `IO::Path` objects are garbage collected or when the `END` phaser
gets run. Note that this means temporary files/directories may be left behind
if your program crashes or gets aborted.

The temporary `IO::Path` objects created by `make-temp-path` and `make-temp-dir`
terms have a role `Temp::Path::AutoDel` role mixed in that will
[`rmtree`](https://github.com/labster/p6-file-directory-tree#rmtree) or
[`.unlink](https://docs.perl6.org/type/IO::Path#routine_unlink) the filesystem
object the path points to.

Note that deletion will happen only if the
path was created by this module. Doing `make-temp-dir.sibling: 'foo'` will
still give you an `IO::Path` with `Temp::Path::AutoDel` mixed in due to how
`IO::Path` methods create new objects, but *that* new object created by
'.sibling' won't be deleted, because *you* created it and not the module.

# SEE ALSO

There's [`File::Temp`](https://modules.perl6.org/repo/File::Temp) module, but I
advise against using it.
